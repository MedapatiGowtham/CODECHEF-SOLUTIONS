# Boats to Save People

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an  **infinite number of boats**  where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return  *the minimum number of boats to carry every given person*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104
- 1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104

        Arrays.sort(people);
        while(left <= right) {
            int x = people[left] + people[right];
            if(x <= limit) {
                left++;
            }
            right--;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
