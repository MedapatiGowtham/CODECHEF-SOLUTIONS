## Problem

### Introduction to jsx

In the last lesson, we saw how to create a React element using plain JavaScript. While this works, most developers prefer a special syntax called  **JSX (JavaScript XML)**  to make writing React components easier and more readable.

### JSX vs JavaScript

Using `JavaScript` alone, we would write something like this:

```
export function App() {
  return (
    'h1',
    { id: 'greeting' },
    'Hello, React!'
 );
}

```

Now, let's see the same example written in `JSX`:

```
export function App() {
  return (
    <h1 id="greeting">
        Hello, React!
    </h1>
 );
}

```

`JSX` makes the code much easier to read and write. Instead of multiple function calls, we use an `HTML`-like syntax to define our elements.

### Why JSX is Useful

`JSX` is not required to write React, but it makes development much more efficient. Here are a few reasons why `JSX` is widely used:

- Readability: JSX looks much like HTML, making it easier to understand.
- Better Structure: JSX allows us to create complex UI structures in an easier-to-follow format.

Now that you understand `JSX`, try creating your own `JSX` element.

### Task:
- Update the App function in App.jsx.
- Add a <p> tag with the text "I am learning JSX!".

The render part of the app is written in main.jsx. This follows the standard structure of a React project.

Once you’ve completed the  **task**, click the Submit button and proceed to the next lesson.

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First React App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- The root div where React will render -->
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!-- Load React and ReactDOM CDN (for quick setup without installing anything) -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    
    <!-- Load our JavaScript file -->
    <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
