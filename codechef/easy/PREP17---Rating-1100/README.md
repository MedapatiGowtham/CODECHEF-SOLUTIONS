## Problem

### Maximum Common Elements

Given two arrays $A$ and $B$, each of size $N$, where each array consists of  **distinct**  elements.

Find the number of elements that are common in both the arrays.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$ — the size of both the arrays. The second line contains $N$ space separated integers - the elements of array $A$. The third line contains $N$ space separated integers - the elements of array $B$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the number of elements that are common in both the arrays.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9$, the values $A_i$ are distinct.
- $1 \leq B_i \leq 10^9$, the values $B_i$ are distinct.
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

2 4 1
1 4 2
1
2
3

```

```

3
0

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  There are $3$ common elements in both the arrays, which are, $1, 3,$ and $4$.

 **Test case $2$:**  There are $3$ common elements in both the arrays, which are, $1, 2,$ and $4$.

 **Test case $3$:**  There are no common elements between both arrays.

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        while(t-- > 0) {
            int n = sc.nextInt();
            int a[] = new int[n];
            int b[] = new int[n];
            for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                a[i] = sc.nextInt();
            }
            for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                b[i] = sc.nextInt();
            }
            Arrays.sort(a);
            Arrays.sort(b);
            int h1 = n-1, h2 = n-1, ans = 0;
            while(h1>=0 && h2>=0) {
                if(a[h1] == b[h2]) {
                    ans++;
                }
                if(a[h1] > b[h2]) {
                    h1--;
                } else {
                    h2--;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(ans);
        }
    }
}
```
