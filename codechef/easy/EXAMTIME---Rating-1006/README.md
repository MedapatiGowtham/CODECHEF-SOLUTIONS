## Problem

### TCS Examination

Two friends, Dragon and Sloth, are writing a computer science examination series. There are three subjects in this series: $\text{DSA}$, $\text{TOC}$, and $\text{DM}$. Each subject carries $100$ marks.

You know the individual scores of both Dragon and Sloth in all $3$ subjects. You have to determine who got a better rank.

The rank is decided as follows:

- The person with a bigger total score gets a better rank
- If the total scores are tied, the person who scored higher in $\text{DSA}$ gets a better rank
- If the total score and the $\text{DSA}$ score are tied, the person who scored higher in $\text{TOC}$ gets a better rank
- If everything is tied, they get the same rank.
### Input Format
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers denoting the scores of Dragon in $\text{DSA}$, $\text{TOC}$ and $\text{DM}$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains three space-separated integers denoting the scores of Sloth in $\text{DSA}$, $\text{TOC}$ and $\text{DM}$ respectively.
### Output Format
- For each test case, if Dragon got a better rank then output "Dragon", else if Sloth got a better rank then output "Sloth". If there was a tie then output "Tie". Note that the string you output should not contain quotes.
- The output is case insensitive. For example, If the output is "Tie" then "TiE", "tiE", "tie", etc are also considered correct.
### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- Each score of both Dragon and Sloth lies between $0$ and $100$.
### Subtasks

 **Subtask #1 (100 points):**  Original constraints

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
10 20 30
30 20 10
5 23 87
5 23 87
0 15 100
100 5 5
50 50 50
50 49 51

```

```
SLOTH
TIE
DRAGON
DRAGON
```

### Explanation:
- For the first test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same total score but Sloth gets a better rank because he has a higher score in $\text{DSA}$.
- For the second test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same rank because they have the same score among all subjects.
- For the third test case, Dragon gets a better rank because he has a greater total score.
- For the fourth test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same total score and same $\text{DSA}$ score. Dragon gets a better rank because he has a greater $\text{TOC}$ score.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = sc.nextInt();

        while (T-- > 0) {
            int d1 = sc.nextInt();
            int t1 = sc.nextInt();
            int m1 = sc.nextInt();

            int d2 = sc.nextInt();
            int t2 = sc.nextInt();
            int m2 = sc.nextInt();

            int total1 = d1 + t1 + m1;
            int total2 = d2 + t2 + m2;

            if (total1 > total2) {
                System.out.println("Dragon");
            } else if (total2 > total1) {
                System.out.println("Sloth");
            } else if (d1 > d2) {
                System.out.println("Dragon");
            } else if (d2 > d1) {
                System.out.println("Sloth");
            } else if (t1 > t2) {
                System.out.println("Dragon");
            } else if (t2 > t1) {
                System.out.println("Sloth");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Tie");
            }
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
```
